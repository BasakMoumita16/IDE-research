 # Brackets
 > A useful open source text editor that understands web design.
 ## Link Below:
 [Brackets](http://brackets.io/ "Brackets")

  ### Pros :smiley:
 
 - Built-in browser live-updating
Brackets will automatically refresh the browser and load the latest saved version of a file open in the browser. This works with php as well. 
- Editing a css will even highlight the tag that's currently being worked on. However, it only works with Chrome.

- Lightweight
Brackets is easy on memory usage and it starts up quickly.



- Drag and drop support
Brackets supports drag and drop of text, as well as multi / rectangular selection.


### Cons :disappointed:

 - Problematic updater
Though the website says there is an update available, the updater in Brackets may give you an error, resulting in you having to download updates manually.

 - Supports only web languages by default <but>
-  Brackets is built for web development and that's where it excels at out of the box. Other languages that have a CodeMirror mode can be added as well.)
  
  
<and language support plugins can be added>

- Some gaps have to be filled by plugins, while these features should be built in.
For example <br> -Jump to matching brace (bracket / parenthesis);
Gutter selection of lines;
Recall previous searches / replacements;
Autofill of search field with text under caret (text has to be selected);
Show whitespace / end of lines / indentation guides / right margin;
Selection to upper / lower case;
and some more.


### Bracket vs Visual Studio Code vs Atom

| Brackets      | Visual Studio Code          | Atom  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Simple               | Complex | Simple |
| Live Preview Function    | Intelli-sense      |  Auto Completion |


### Code Block

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">  
document.write("Brackets is compatible with JavaScript");  
</script>  
```

### Number one reason for using brackets

 * [x] Simple
 * [ ] User Friendly
 * [ ] Free
